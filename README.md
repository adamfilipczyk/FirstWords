# FirstWords
First Words teaches kids how to build the words with the help of pictures,sounds and drag'n'drop mechanism. First Words is a simple spelling game. A whole project was initated by my few years old daughter Natasha in the middle ohf June 2015. She basically asked me for some new mobile game, so we've agreed we can try to build one from scratch.

We have planned 10 categories. Initially only one category is active. Every completed category unlocks the next one. Each category contains 9-15 words, and there is a 116 words all together, so it's a nice starting tool for the kids who want to learn how to spell. 

Each word is loaded with the help of little picture and sound. Natasha's voice is used so she has a nice contribution to a whole project. The rules are very easy. As mentioned each word is loaded with the picture and Natasha voice who says what's on the picture. Also little bubble letters and black containers appears next to the picture. Bubble letters has to be properly moved down to the black containers with the help of drag-n-drop mechanism. Every time the word is spelled wrong, Natasha's voice will say that something went wrong. While the word is spelled correctly the application automatically redirects to the next word. After all words in the category are properly done, congratulation screen will pop up, and one star will be added to the bottom of the choosing category screen. After every second category is completed, the screen with 2 minutes break will pop up, and if someone does not want to take a break, there is an option to skip the break by tapping the lazy bee belly. 

The application was wrote the way that it does remember its state, so every time the app is closed and reopened it will reopen to the last finished category. After last category is completed the game is finished and the option to reset the game will appear, so the child can start the game from the beginning again 

Application is designed for the phones and tablets running Android in version 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and up. Minimum screen size is set to 4.7 inch and bigger up to 10 inches. Application does not contain any form of advertisement, nor monetizing systems built in, so there no obstacles and it is safe to use by kids. Also there is no additional permissions required during the installation process and it is totally free to use.

The application initially published in Google Store, but due to the Google agresive policies it was removed and accessible on the GitHub project page only.
